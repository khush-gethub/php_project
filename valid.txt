1. Frontend (Client-Side) Validation
This validation happens in the user's browser to provide immediate feedback and improve user experience.

What it checks:
Required Fields: Ensures that forms (like signup and new post) are not submitted with empty fields.
Password Matching: Confirms that the password and confirmation password match during signup.
Image Rules: Validates image file types and sizes before uploading.
Example: If a user tries to sign up without a username, the form will show an error message and will not submit.

2. Backend (Server-Side) Validation
This is the most critical validation layer, protecting the database from invalid or malicious data. It is handled by the express-validator library.

What it checks:
Data Integrity: Re-validates all data from the frontend, such as email format and password length.
Uniqueness: Ensures that each user has a unique email address.
API Rules: Enforces rules on all API endpoints (e.g., a new blog post must have a title).
Example: If a request is sent to the server to create a user with an email that already exists, the server will respond with a "User already exists" error.

  3. Authentication & Authorization Validation

This layer ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources.

What it checks:
User Authentication: Verifies that a user is logged in before they can create a post.
User Roles & Permissions: Differentiates between regular users and admins, ensuring that only admins can access the admin panel. Content Ownership: Prevents users from editing or deleting blog posts that they do not own.
Example: If a regular user tries to access the admin dashboard, they will be blocked with an "unauthorized" error.
